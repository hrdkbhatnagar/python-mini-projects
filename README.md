Notebooks for understanding and exploring python, matplotlib, and other various other useful libraries for data science.

 The details of the notebooks are as follows:

- **[Clustering (t-SNE, PCA)](https://github.com/hrdkbhatnagar/python-mini-projects/blob/main/clustering_tSNE_PCA.ipynb)** - looking into dimension reduction and clustering using methods like t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) and Principal component analysis (PCA).
- [**Curve fitting**](https://github.com/hrdkbhatnagar/python-mini-projects/blob/main/curve_fitting.ipynb) - fitting curves (models) to noisy data with the help of [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) library. Extending the approach to custom made models for fitting the data.
- [**Gradient descent**](https://github.com/hrdkbhatnagar/python-mini-projects/blob/main/gradient_descent_visualization.ipynb) - implementation of gradient descent algorithm. Using the [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) library to compute derivatives of functions and visualizing the results in 2D and 3D.
- [**Interpolation and extrapolation**](https://github.com/hrdkbhatnagar/python-mini-projects/blob/main/interpolation_extrapolation.ipynb) - up-sampling and down-sampling time series data. Using these methods to fix (fill-in) corrupted images (missing pixel values)
